        <pre>
        * Currently liquidations work in manual mode
        - in the first dropdown select position which you want to liquidate
        - in the input field enter value which you have and you want to spend for liquidation
            - initially the repayment value is set according to the borrower's position, decrease the repayment value manually until the error disappears.
            - currently, we didn't check that you have this amount
            - for liquidations of non-ether we will ask to approve tokens for liquidations first
        - in the second dropdown select collateral which you want to receive
            - borrower should have enough of this collateral, we didn't check it automatically (now we show all entered markets of borrower)
        </pre>
